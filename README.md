# Vulnerabilities-Report


# How to reduce Vulnerabilities in a system during development?
 
This report is all about the different ways in which you can reduce vulnerabilities in a system. In the early stages of projects, the designers and programmers don’t take into account that there is always people trying to exploit their systems and trying to test their skills by breaking the security of systems in early development. So hackers and other people trying gain information will take advantage of this and try to exploit games, Software and many other products in its early stages like Alphas and Betas. One example of this If they were to get in to a game in early access then they can gain advantages on games or to take them offline which is bad for the developer and people playing the game. 

It can be very dangerous for people to get into different software’s with the amount of tractions that happen now days everything costs money so people will have their credit card details taken and used before they even realise. That is just one of the many ways we are vulnerable to hacker’s malicious software and many other dangerous tools.

Software development is the process of designing, Programming, Documentation, Testing and Bug Fixing. All of these are involved in creating and maintain applications. The development process is the process of writing and maintaining the source code.

## Secondary Research (Case Study’s)

We have been tasked to find to real world situations that have coursed a lot of problems in the world that have been attached to the lack of security on systems when they are being developed which leaves them open to cyber-attacks latter down the road when the website or program is open to the public.

### Case Study 1: Young Brits 'lack cyber-security awareness'
###### ( http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-43128072 )

The first study I found was all about the lack of awareness of cyber security in this current day for teenagers and young adults. The study was published on BBC News trying to get the attention of these people to read up on security to make sure they safe.

Within the report it states ‘More than 52% of Britons aged 18-25 are using the same password for lots of online services’. This is not a good thing for the millions of online users as if someone was to get your password they would be able to get into multiple of your private accounts and take information. This makes it easier for hackers to hijack accounts.

Another statistic in the report shows about 79% of the 2,261 respondents of all ages said they had sent bank details or copies of passports and driving licences via messaging systems. Which is a crazy number if one person was to send it to the wrong number or to a phishing email then their details would be in danger instantly and then it is too late for you to do anything. 

Det Insp Mick Dodge is a national cyber-protect co-ordinator and he said in a statement with the City of London police. That ‘Your email account is really a treasure trove of information that hackers won't hesitate to exploit’ which he is correct about a lot of forgotten passwords, Reset Passwords and Forgot Usernames will go back to the email that was linked with them when the accounts are created. If a hacker was to get into your email address, then they could see what accounts you have link with it and get into them simply by resetting the passwords. They could get hold of many things like Bank Details, Apple iCloud which can lead to phone numbers, Work Details which can cause trouble if someone is trying to find you. The leads with an email are never ending.

One of the biggest dangers within security is Identity theft if someone was to get your credit card information and email they could easily start ordering things under your name to them with you having no idea. The Report states many people who sent personal information via email rarely deleted it. ‘Bank statements, electronic copies of signatures and other important documents could all be sitting in lists of sent emails’ said Det Insp Dodge.

In the report it also goes on to put the lack of online security into perspective for some people that don’t know much about the online world with a statement that says ‘You wouldn't leave your door open for a burglar, so why give criminals an open invitation to your personal information’. Using the same password and Giving information is as dangerous as letting a burglar into your house could even be worse. 

A lot of people use names of Children, Pets or Favourite Sports. In this day and age this is a bad Idea as so much of people’s personal information is on social media sites like Facebook or Twitter they can easily get hold of this information from pictures, tags or friends.

The UK's Cyber Aware campaign are currently fighting the war with hackers by making sure that all teenagers and adults know how to be safe online. For example, Strong and Separate passwords for your email and social media accounts. They also recommend that you use ‘Two-Factor Authentication’ Which adds another layer of security on your online accounts. This can be good as most of the time it sends a code to your phone via text so you can firstly see that someone is trying to get into your accounts and secondly you can stop them.

### Case Study 2: World Cup 2018: FA increases cyber security over hacking concerns
###### ( http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/41230542 )

The second case study that I found is about the concerns that the FA have over the security of the upon coming World Cup. As it is one of the biggest spectacles in the world as it only shows up once every four years show casing the best players in the world playing for their country. The world cup is about a month away and they are tightening security because of the recent hack they had to do with the Fancy Bears hack. Regarding the use of banned medicines in football. They cannot afford another hack at the world cup.

This particular news report covers the English staff and player and the things they have been advised to do to stay safe from any hacks while away at the world cup. Also it talks about how the FA and Fifa are preparing for the world cup and using past experiences to improve security and keep the players and teams safe when at the world cup  

The players and team have been advised to not use any public or hotel Wi-Fi at the World Cup because of the scare of hackers and the information they can gain from getting into a player’s phone or the teams phones, laptops, tablets. They could be using it for their own use or to help other teams to find out their tactics for the game etc.

In 2015 a hacking group managed to claim information that showed that 160 players had failed drugs tests in 2015. If something like this was to come out before the world cup, then players would be banned. 

The FA are stepping up the cyber security for the world cup as it has concerns with Fifa about its IT security and it is thought to be leaking information of its own correspondence with the governing body.

In the Fancy Bears attack on August 2017. There was an email released from the head of the FA, Jenni Kennedy which revealed details of four different anti-doping cases that happened in May. When all this information was released the FA sent out a response letter that said 

Fifa has informed the FA that [it] remains committed to preventing security attacks in general and that, with respect to the Fancy Bears attack in particular, it is presently investigating the incident to ascertain whether Fifa's infrastructure was compromised.
"Such investigation is still ongoing. For the purposes of computer security in general, Fifa is itself relying on expert advice from third parties.

"It is for this reason that Fifa cannot and does not provide any computer security advice to third parties
Overall, they say they will be putting more focus into the internet security and they will continue to not provide any computer security advice to third parties to keep their data safe. 

FA officials are understood to be increasingly concerned about IT security in Russia, and have been boosting cyber counter-measures. Practical measures have been seen. The governing body strengthen online firewalls and introduce encrypted passwords for websites and devices. They are also reminding players about the existing guidelines relating to their social media 

The BBC reporter Zoe Kleinman says ‘Many cyber-attacks are believed to originate in Russia and sensitive data about upcoming matches would certainly be valuable as it could then be used to place bets on various outcomes.

Once a hacker has access to a Wi-Fi router they can snoop on any of the data being shared on other devices that are connected to it. They can also install a digital backdoor to guarantee re-entry should their access be blocked.

It would also be easy to spoof a free Wi-Fi hotspot, so that the user might think they were logging on via an official platform but what they would actually be doing is opening up their entire device to a scammer.

Messaging apps such as WhatsApp and Signal use end-to-end encryption, which means messages cannot be read if they are intercepted - the players will no doubt be encouraged to communicate using the most secure possible platforms.


## Primary Research: Questionnaire 

In the primary research we had to find out how to reduce vulnerabilities in a system during its development. So I decided to make this questionnaire then take it around the college and give it out to other IT students to see what they know about the vulnerabilities in a system and how to reduce them. The three questions that I aimed to answer with my questionnaire were 

* Do the students know what keeps them safe online and how to reduce the vulnerabilities of getting hacked online?
* If asked can the students point out vulnerabilities and suggest what can stop them?
* Have any of the students ever been targeted by a form of cyber-attack?

### Primary Research (Question 1)
With the first question I knew that these students should have a good understanding of the internet, hacking and what you can do to stay safe. So I wanted to ask them all about malware and virus protection (anti-virus software). Also I wanted to ask them about their passwords and do they believe that the passwords they made to protect their work and themselves is trustworthy and cannot be hacked.

Do the students know what keeps them safe online and how to reduce the vulnerabilities of getting hacked online?

The outcome of the questions based around my main question was very interesting. I asked them three questions. 
Firstly, Do you currently use any Malware/ Virus protection for your PC? Which had a very interesting outcome. Out of twenty students that I asked only 13 of them are currently using antivirus software. Which I thought would be much higher as they are software development and programming students they are forever downloading and uploading things.
![eeeee](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/31927415/40078158-bf0247ac-587b-11e8-880c-e16d5d752ca5.png)

My second and third question go together to answer the main question. The two questions I asked them was out of 10 how strong do you believe your password is also doing you use it for multiple accounts. And the third question is what makes a strong password.

The results of this all fit in with the antivirus question as well. Most of the students that using an antivirus software also have a strong password and multiple of them for their accounts. The people that do not use any protection do not have strong passwords and they use the same password for all their accounts. So if someone was able to get into their PC because of the lack of protection they would be able to get hold of one password and have access to everything in their PC which is not good. It is good to see that the people with strong passwords also have many of them so if something was to get past their antivirus software they would not be able to get their passwords, worst case they get into one of your accounts but by then you can change all your passwords

Overall for my first question, Do the students know what keeps them safe online and how to reduce the vulnerabilities of getting hacked online? I believe that all the students know how to keep everything safe but some of them are lacking the fact that if someone was to get into your PC they can become you. So the students are not looking at the vulnerabilities and effects of getting hacked online they don’t seem to be worried about it either with having the same password for all their accounts. It will only take one hack for them to get some protecting and change their passwords but I hope it doesn’t come to that and they change them, themselves.

### Primary Research (Question 2)
The second question I wanted to answer with my primary research was, if asked can the students point out vulnerabilities and suggest what can stop them? I wanted to see if these software developers and programmers can easily spot something wrong with a phishing email and problems between two passwords. I was hoping this would also teach them that if they have seen something like the email of password before they can now know how to not get effected. 

So firstly I showed them a picture of a phishing email which they are trying to get you to log in so they can get your personal data I tasked them in the question too circle the reasons this is a phishing email. There was a total of four things that pointed out it was a phishing email if you look at the table below you can see their results.

I also asked them to tell me which password would be hacked first between two different passwords with different characters and random letters. I wanted to see if they knew what made a password safe by looking at the two and also they could list why they thought it was a stronger password than the other. The results of this was fourteen of the students thought it was password A, they were correct the password had capitals and lower case also it had numbers and characters. The other six students thought it was B. Although B had Capitals and Numbers it contained simple duplicates of letters and numbers so it can be hacked almost instantly

Overall the results of the three questionnaire questions showed me exactly what I needed to help answer the second main question of If asked can the students point out vulnerabilities and suggest what can stop them? I wanted to see mainly that the students knew what a vulnerability is and how they can avoid and stop them. If you don’t know how to avoid them then you are going to probably walk straight into one and before you know they are you with your identity and they have taken everything from your PC.

### Primary Research (Question 3)

The third question I asked the students was, have any of the students ever been targeted by a form of cyber-attack? I wanted to know if any of them had ever been targeted by a virus or any other type of cyber-attack and if so what type of attack was it
![er](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/31927415/40078331-21478cd8-587c-11e8-8851-04cde01a6c11.jpg)

Above you can see the results of this question from my questionnaire. It was split 50/50 which means ten people have been targeted by a virus before and for all we know the other ten may have been targeted but to their knowledge they don’t know if they have. The people that know they have been targeted shared a few of the attacks they have received. One of them was a trojan horse, another was a Phishing Email. One person even said he had people brute forcing his email. 

It is good to see that most of them know when they have been attacked so they can act upon it and fix the problem and get rid of the virus. A problem can occur when the user does not know when they have a virus on their PC and it begins to take over then it can cause a problem. 

## Overall Conclusion: How To Reduce Vulnerabilities In A System During Development?

Including my Primary and Secondary research we had to produce a report that covered reducing vulnerabilities. I used my secondary research to find more world known actions of this using news websites. But we also had to have an option from the other side which is personal which is my primary research using a questionnaire I gave out in my college. They both came back with very valid results in their own field
